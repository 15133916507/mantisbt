	<title>Reminders</title>

	<para>Sending reminders is a feature where a user can notify /
		remind other users about a bug. In the past, only selected users
		like the managers, or developers would get notified about bugs.
		However, these people can not invite other people (through MantisBT)
		to look at or monitor these bugs.
	</para>
	<para>This feature is useful if the Manager needs to get feedback
		from testers / requirements team about a certain bug. It avoid
		needing this person to do this manual outside MantisBT. It also
		records the history of such reminders.
	</para>

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>$g_store_reminders</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>Specifies if reminders should be stored as bugnotes. The
					bugnote will still reflect that it is a reminder and list the names
					of users that got it. Default is ON.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>$g_reminder_recipients_monitor_bug</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>Specifies if users who receive reminders about a bug, should
					be automatically added to the monitor list of that bug. Default is
					ON.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	</variablelist>

	<varlistentry>
		<term>$g_mentions_enabled</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Enables or disables the @ mentions feature.  Default is ON.
				When a user is @ mentioned, they are added to the monitor list
				and hence they get a notification about the event (e.g. note addition
				or issue submission). Users can be @ mentioned using their username
				and not realname.
			</para>
			<para>
				This feature works with fields like summary, description, additional info,
				steps to reproduce and notes.  Before such fields are saved the @ mention
				for username is replaced with a reference to the user id (e.g. @{U123}).
				At display time, the reference to the user id is replaced by the username
				or real name based on settings.  This also allows retaining @ mentions
				correctly even if a username is changed or as a user is deleted.
