Hello Rafik,

Thank you for using Ace admin. I'm really glad you have been using it and your users liked it as well.
And congratulations for MantisBT. It looks like a great service.

About your question if you have an extended license that pretty much covers your case. That is, you can make a product
with Ace as part of it and distribute it.

Hope that helps,
Let me know if you have a question

Kind Regards,
Mohsen
